lispy_python_1
==============

A basic interpreter of mathematical expressions written in a Lisp-like manner. Runs REPL-style, continuously evaluating input and returning the results of expressions as output. Makes use of ply (http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) for string tokenization and grammar parsing.
